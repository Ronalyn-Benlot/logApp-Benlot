# <b>Log Application</b>
<br/>
     <i>For the last two years we have been fighting covid-19. It is very difficult for us to go out of our houses, especially the young and the elderly, because we do not know when and where we can get the covid 19 disease. A solution was made to make it easier to know and identify people we met especially in malls. Before entering the malls we must write our personal information in a logbook for contact tracing, therefore the log application has been created where people will enter their information digitally to make it more easier and faster. It is also an application where the admin can log in and can be able to see all the people who filled up the form.</i>
